Examples
========

The `templates directory <https://github.com/mustafaquraish/marker/tree/master/templates>`_
inside the repository provides example setups of how to use this marker to run
tests on both Python and C code. In general you can use this for any programming
language as long as you have a way to run individual tests from the command line.

For use with C, a minimal unit-testing library ``marker.h`` with example usage 
is also provided, but any of the more popular testing frameworks for C work well too. 

Please feel free to get in touch if you need help setting up the marker to work
with a particular programming langauge / setup, and if I have some time I'll
try to have a look. You're also more than welcome to upload more templates for
other setups if you find that they would be useful.
