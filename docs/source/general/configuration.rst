Configuration File
==================

This page just serves to show a complete configuration file with all the default 
options filled in, including information for all the submission platforms. The 
pages for each of the specific commands describe in detail which options are 
used for what purposes.

Any option that has a default value does not need to be explicitly specified.

Heirarchy
---------

If the defaults below don't fit your needs, and you would like to more sane
defaults, you can put them in ``~/.config/marker/config.yml``. When the marker
is instantiated, options are loaded in to following order:

* Options listed on this page (*lowest priority*)
* ``~/.config/marker/config.yml``
* Configuration file specified in CLI (*highest priority*)
